TODO :)

Uses SFML from git (2.0, unreleased) since it is buttloads better.

Periodically sync with releases from: http://sfgui.sfml-dev.de/download
and

CHIPMUNK http://chipmunk-physics.net/downloads.php.
CURRENT VERSION: 6.1.1

or use
TGUI http://en.sfml-dev.org/forums/index.php?topic=7023.0

it seems nice as well, and maybe the best choice at the present time

PARTICLES, neat stuff, may find useful:
