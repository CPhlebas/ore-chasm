# Ore Chasm

## What is it?

Ore Chasm is a game that is greatly inspired by Terraria, but of course aims to
be more.

## What license is it under?

All assets are required (by me ;) to be under a Free and Open license.
The code is presently under GPLv2+ as that seems to be the licence
I like the most.

## What platforms will it run on?

The goal initially is to make it run on Linux/Unixen, Mac OS X and Windows.
I'm a developer on Linux, as that's the only real way to program, so this
will likely get the most support.

I would love to see it run on Android for instance. But for this to happen
I'd have to wait until SFML has ports to that/those platforms. Or switch
to a different framework if that becomes the only option.

## How can I help out?

Merge requests/patches. They will need to match my coding style, which isn't too
difficult (and there's an astyle script at the root directory for ease of use).
And of course, fix the issue. I love features, so chances are I'm going to accept
your patch if it does the job nicely. I'm not too overlordy when it comes to code.
Oh and of course, all other assets are *most* welcome. Of course, they'll also
have to be released under a free license.

Coding style:  http://techbase.kde.org/Policies/Kdelibs_Coding_Style
use astyle.sh file to automatically format everything to this.

I'll do so ruthlessly every so often. I'd rather have clean code than easy history

## How do I install it?
First of all, I use SFML 2.0, which is technically unreleased.

No matter, you can build it easily since I use CMake.

See: http://sfgui.sfml-dev.de/download

After this is installed and you have followed their directions, to get my code,
you can either click download the zip, or run `git clone git://github.com/sreich/ore-chasm.git`
